# DDD
This is a very simple project for exposing how is a Domain-Driven design project. The next lines explain what is DDD and why is so important to implement this type of 
solution in your next projects.

## Domain-Driven Design

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a software development approach introduced by Eric Evans in his book "Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software".

üß† Core Idea:
Focus on the core domain of the business and build software around its domain logic, using a shared understanding between developers and domain experts.

üîë Key Concepts:
Domain: The area of knowledge or activity your application is built to serve (e.g., e-commerce, banking).
Model: A structured representation of domain knowledge in code.
Ubiquitous Language: A common language shared by developers and domain experts, based on the domain model.
Bounded Context: A logical boundary within which a particular domain model applies consistently.
Entities: Objects with a distinct identity that persists over time (e.g., Customer, Order).
Value Objects: Immutable objects without identity (e.g., Address, Money).
Aggregates: A cluster of domain objects that are treated as a single unit for data changes.
Repositories: Interfaces for retrieving and storing aggregates.
Services: Stateless operations that don't naturally belong to any entity or value object.

‚öôÔ∏è Benefits:
Aligns code with business needs.
Encourages clean architecture and separation of concerns.
